# Online Animal Shelter

## Description 
This project is the final project of the Java Development Bootcamp, conducted in a group. This project aims to facilitate the adoption of stray animals in need of new homes by the general public through an online platform. Within this application, users can submit adoption requests to shelters, which have the ability to review and respond to these requests by either accepting or rejecting them. In this project, we use Java Spring Boot RestClient API for retrieving shelter addresses and JWT for authentication.

3. Adoption Request
   - Potential adopters can browse through animal profiles that only has status AVAILABLE.
   - Once an adopter finds a suitable animal, they can submit an adoption request through the API.
   - he schedule for home inspection will automatically shown the day after adoption request.
